                    <p>
                        We generally collect personal information directly from the individual. For example, when an individual submits an account application form online, visits our website, calls us or sends us correspondence we will collect personal information. Sometimes
                        we may collect personal information about the individual from a third party. When we are provided with personal information from a third party, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that the individual is or has been made aware
                        of the matters set out in this Privacy Policy. We may also collect credit information about an individual from credit reporting bodies to assist us in assessing an individual’s application to open an account.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ZEYFEX will not collect sensitive information unless the individual has consented or an exemption under the Privacy Act applies. These exceptions include if the collection is required or authorised by law or is necessary to take appropriate action in
                        relation to suspected unlawful activity or serious misconduct.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the personal information we request is not provided by an individual, we may not be able to provide the individual with the benefit of our services, or meet their needs appropriately.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ZEYFEX does not give individuals the option of dealing with them anonymously, or under a pseudonym, as ZEYFEX is required to identify all trading clients under the St. Vincent & the Grenadines Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Regulations
                        2014, as amended. In addition, it is impracticable for ZEYFEX to deal with individuals who have no identified themselves or us a pseudonym.

                    <p>
